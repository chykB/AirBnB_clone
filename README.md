# AirBnB Clone Project
This is an Airbnb clone project that focuses on building a command-line interface (CLI) application, known as "The Console," to manage and interact with the backend data of the Airbnb clone. The application is written in Python and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts to provide a user-friendly interface for managing property listings, users, bookings, and more.


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand how to:
+ create a Python package
+ create a command interpreter using the cmd module
+ serialize and deserialize a Class
+ write and read a JSON file
+ manage datetime
+ handle named arguments in a function
+ How to use Args and Kwargs

## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration�~@�

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place�~@�) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
